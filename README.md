SpiderMonkey
============

SpiderMonkey is Mozilla's JavaScript engine written in C/C++. It is used in various Mozilla products, including Firefox, and is available under the MPL2.

This is a mirror of Mozilla's SpiderMonkey project that I'm using to manage my work, studies and contributions. Feel free to fork it, because the master brach I'm going to keep dailly updated!

For documentations details, see the [SpiderMonkey](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/SpiderMonkey
) pages on the Mozilla Developer Center.
